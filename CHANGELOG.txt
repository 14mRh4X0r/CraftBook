1.2.1:
- Added a recursion limit to the redstone processing.
- Increased the height that mobs spawned at with MC1200 by one block up.

1.2:
- Water and lava can now be used reliably as ingredients. Specify
    moving water/lava, not the stationary water/lava.
- Rewrote redstone triggering for bridges and gates. They will now not
    trigger by redstone as easily -- they now act more like doors and
    other redstone components in that the wire must run up to the sign
    and not just merely pass by it. Note that you can also run wires
    directly underneath the sign and that will work.
- Added redstone integrated circuits. They compact complicated and
    otherwise impossible components into very small functional blocks.
- Pumpkin redstone input triggering has been expanded so that you can lead
    wires up to it instead of only under it. Note that you should not
    put redstone components above pumpkins as pumpkins tend to 'eat' the
    redstone items.
- CraftBook now has conditional hook registration so that it will not
    completely fail if a feature of hMod is not available for
    whatever reason.
- New ammeter (coal) can be right clicked on redstone components to get
    their current level.
- Bridges can now cut through water, allowing you to make flat flood gates
    in addition to vertical flood gates (with the gate feature). This also
    applies to lava so that you can make lava flood gates.
- Fixed the /elevator permission not working, added /togglearea
    and /bridge as permissions.
- Added create permissions that allow you to restrict the *creation* of
    features (such as bridges and gates). check-create-permissions must
    be enabled (default not).
- Bookshelf and apple drops should now occur at the place of the block
    and not at the player's feet.
- Updated for the new server update.
- Caught IOException thrown by the new properties class in hMod.

1.1:
- Pumpkins can be toggled off and on (between their lit and unlit states) by
    putting redstone under the pumpkin.
- Bridges now support redstone. Wire to the sign.
- Gates now support redstone. Just wire the sign itself.
- Bridge signs can now be *below* the bridge and out of view.
- Bridges can now be made out of other blocks (although the entire bridge
    has to be of one type). Change the list of allowable blocks in
    CraftBook's properties file.
- The maximum length of bridges can now be configured.
- [I] can be used instead of [|] for light switches.
- You can now do 'grass1:dirt*3,sapling:grass*3' for cauldron
    configuration (multipliers and item names). Comments can also now
    start with the sharp (#) sign.

0.4:
- Added the bridge.
- Added toggle-able areas.
- Added chest support to prevent item farming.
- Apple drop chance can be a decimal number. Now use -1 to disable entirely.
- Added support for setting permissions for each function so only some
    groups can use some functions.
- Fixed sign posts not working for some functions.
- Added the ability to change the "you pick out a book..." message for the
    book reading feature.

0.3:
- b123 (Halloween update) compatible.

0.2:
- Added the elevator.
- Added the cauldron.
- Added apple drops.
- Added bookshelf drops.
- Made book reading code able to handle the first and last lines of a file.
- Made the gate toggle range slightly larger so you can toggle larger gates
    and you don't have to have the sign up very high.

0.1:
- Initial release.
