#
# This file is a list of minecart craft recipes. Each line has 4 fields that
# are separated by colons (:):
#
#     1. Recipe name
#     2. Ingredients
#     3. Resulting items
#     4. Groups that can use this recipe (optional field)
#
# The name can be anything. The two lists are block/item IDs and you
# can use block/item names as well (that are in your items.txt or
# items table). If you need multiple copies of one item or block, use
# * followed by the multiplier, so 1*4 means 4 of item 1 (stone).
#
# If one recipe's ingredients are a subset of another, it should go below
# the other recipe.
#
# Groups can be added like in the cauldron recipes, but are NOT used
# currently.
#
# Lines starting with a sharp symbol (#) are comments and are ignored. Blank
# lines are OK.
