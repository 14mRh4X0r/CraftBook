Directory layout
----------------

  craftbook/
    <contents of craftbook repo here>
    lib/
      minecraft_server.jar 
      WorldEdit.jar
      Minecraft_Mod.jar
      JFlex.jar

Change to the craftbook directory, and execute 'ant' to generate CraftBook.jar,
which you can then install as normal. (see INSTALL.txt) JFlex is not needed for
this operation.

Note that if the grammar definition files (they have the .lex extension), you
must run 'ant run-jflex' for your changes to take effect. Jflex is required
for this operation. It should also be noted that the .lex files re-compiled by
run-jflex are hardcoded, and build.xml must be modified to add new ones.
