;
; This file is a list of couldron recipes. Each line has 3 fields that
; are separated by colons (:):
;
;     1. Recipe name
;     2. Ingredients
;     3. Resulting items
;
; The name can be anything. The two lists are block/item IDs.
;
; If one recipe's ingredients are a subset of another, it should go below
; the other recipe.
;
; Lines starting with a semi-colon (;) are comments and are ignored. Blank
; lines are OK.
