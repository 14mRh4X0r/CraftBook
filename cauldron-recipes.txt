#
# This file is a list of cauldron recipes. Each line has 4 fields that
# are separated by colons (:):
#
#     1. Recipe name
#     2. Ingredients
#     3. Resulting items
#     4. Groups that can use this recipe (optional field)
#
# The name can be anything. The two lists are block/item IDs and you
# can use block/item names as well (that are in your items.txt or
# items table). If you need multiple copies of one item or block, use
# * followed by the multiplier, so 1*4 means 4 of item 1 (stone).
#
# To add color/damage values, place an @ symbol after the item ID and then
# the color/damage value.
# Ex: 35@1*4 means 4 of item 35 (wool) colored 1 (orange)
#
# Enchantment values use the & symbol followed by the enchantment name or
#     enchantment ID #
#     ID #'s can be found here:
#     http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Enchanting#Enchantment_Types
#     under the EID column on the far left.
# Enchantment names use a special format meant to fit on signs, so it is
#     better to use the ID #'s
# Enchantments can be placed anywhere after the item ID.
# Ex1: 276&Smite is a diamond sword (276) with Smite I
# Ex2: 276&Smite&Bane of Arthro
#     is a diamond sword with Smite I and Bane of Arthropods I
# Ex3: 276&17 is a diamond sword with Smite I (17)
# For optional enchantment levels, put a # symbol after then enchantment
# name, then put the level number.
# Ex: 276&Smite#5 is a diamond sword with Smite V
#
# If one recipe's ingredients are a subset of another, it should go below
# the other recipe.
#
# If you want a recipe to be usuable by everyone, don't put anything
# for the last field. If you want to list multiple groups, separate them
# by commas.
#
# Lines starting with a sharp symbol (#) are comments and are ignored. Blank
# lines are OK.
