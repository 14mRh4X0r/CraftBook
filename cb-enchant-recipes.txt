# List of custom Enchantment recipes
#
# Recipes are created in the workbench block or player
#     2x2 inventory crafting slots if the recipe fits.
# Recipes will also match flipped shapes. So an L shaped recipe
#     is the same as a backwards L shaped recipe.
#
# Format
# (may be easier to look at the examples near the bottom first)
#     1. Recipes start with the line "recipe:" (without quotes)
#     2. Resulting Enchantment type and optional level
#         ex: Smite#2 will add Smite II to the item, Smite will
#         add Smite I
#     3. Item type to add the Enchantment to.
#         Swords, diamond swords, helmets, boots, etc
#     4. First row of recipe item locations in the 3x3 workbench
#         crafting area.
#         This will be 3 characters max. Each character
#         represents where an item needs to be in the workbench.
#         Spaces ' ' can be used for empty boxes
#     5. Second row of item locations. Same 3 characters max.
#         This row is required even if the recipe is just 1 row.
#     6. Third row of item locations. Same 3 characters max.
#         This row is required even if the recipe is 1 or 2 rows.
#     7. The following lines will be the definitions for the
#         characters used in the 3x3 item locations.
#
# NOTE!
# letter case (upper/lower) matters for characters used in the
#     recipe shape (lines 4, 5, & 6)
#     Example: 'g' is different from 'G'
#
# Item formats are the same as in Cauldron and Cart Craft recipes
#     @ specifies color/damage
#     * specifies the amount
#     & specifies enchantment
#     # after an enchantment specifies enchantment level
# Item names are either names found in the items.txt server
#     config, or the id numbers.
#
# Names that can be used to represent any item of the same type:
#     Helmet
#     Chestplate
#     Leggings
#     Boots
#     Sword
#     Shovel
#     Pickaxe
#     Axe
#     Bow
#     Hoe
# Ex: Using "Sword" will match any type of sword (gold, diamond,
#    iron, wood, etc).
