When using the OWorld.class file,
MAKE SURE THE CROW/CANARY VERSION IS THE SAME!

Using OWorld.class on an incorrect crow/canary version may cause
server bugs, errors, crashes.


ABOUT
==========
The custom OWorld.class file adds an extra plugin hook that
allows more control over minecart collisions.

This is only needed if you wish to use some of the special
minecart collision modes CraftBook extra has. Such as the 
ability to harm animals that get in the way of a moving 
minecart.



INSTALL
==========
It is recommended to create a copy of the CanaryMod.jar
server file before continuing. This will allow you to 
easily go back to the original version.

1) Stop the crow/canary server properly, if running.
2) Open CanaryMod.jar with WinRAR or similar program.
3) Drag the OWorld.class file into the WinRAR window,
    which should add the modified OWorld.class file to
    CanaryMod.jar
4) In the craftbook.properties server file, set:
    minecart-using-oworld-server-file=false
     to
    minecart-using-oworld-server-file=true
4a) You can also change the "minecart-collision-type="
    value to the collision mode you would like to have.
5) Save the craftbook.properties changes
6) Done.
    Start up the crow/canary server and your collision
    mode should start working properly.
